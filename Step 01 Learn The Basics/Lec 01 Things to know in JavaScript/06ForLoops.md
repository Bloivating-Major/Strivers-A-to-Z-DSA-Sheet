# Lecture 01: For Loops in JavaScript 🚴‍♂️

Loops are essential in programming—they let you repeat actions without writing the same code over and over. The `for` loop is one of the most commonly used loops in JavaScript!

## What is a For Loop? 🤔

A `for` loop lets you run a block of code a specific number of times. It's perfect for iterating over arrays, counting, or repeating tasks.

## Basic Syntax 📝

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
  // code to execute in each iteration
}
```

- **Initialization:** Set up a counter variable (usually `let i = 0`).
- **Condition:** The loop runs as long as this is `true`.
- **Increment:** Update the counter after each iteration.

## Example: Counting from 1 to 5 🔢

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Count:", i);
}
// Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```

## Example: Looping Through an Array 🛒

```javascript
let fruits = ["🍎", "🍌", "🍊", "🍇"];

for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
  console.log("Fruit:", fruits[i]);
}
// Output: 🍎 🍌 🍊 🍇
```

## Creative Use: Printing a Pattern ⭐

```javascript
let stars = "";
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  stars += "*";
  console.log(stars);
}
/*
Output:
*
**
***
****
*****
*/
```

## Tips & Tricks 💡

- You can use any variable name, not just `i`.
- The loop can count up or down (`i++` or `i--`).
- You can nest loops for multi-dimensional data (like matrices).

## When to Use For Loops? 🚦

- When you know how many times you want to repeat something.
- When iterating over arrays or strings.
- When generating patterns or performing calculations.

## Summary 🎉

The `for` loop is a powerful tool for repetition in JavaScript. Mastering it will help you solve many programming challenges efficiently!
